They took that thing out of the attic, but I still can't get a good night's sleep without thinking there's something rotten in the walls of this house. And you wanna know what the worst part is? I couldn't even tell what they pulled out. Maybe it was some kind of rat? It looked like it had been torn to shreds, like it was all fleshy and inside out. And I'd go back into the attic to try and see if something else died up there, but there's this black door at the top of the stairs, and for the life of me I can't remember the attic door being that dark. It's really freaking me out. Anyways, I'm sorry I haven't written to you in a while Ma, but I've been busy moving all my stuff in and all that. Just gimme like another week and I should be all settled in, and by then the letters will just start pourin' in. Just you wait!
