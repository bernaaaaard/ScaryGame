Plenty of space to put in whatever you want, as you can see we’ve got this very comfortable couch that the previous owner left behind, but if you want to take this out and replace it, I'm sure you'd have no trouble. This room gets plenty of light during the day and let me say, it is a VERY cozy spot to sit down and watch some TV in. Moving onto the garage…”","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Garage":["^”The garage is plenty wide. You could easily fit two cars in here and have some room to spare. Right over here we have some tools also left behind from the last owner — nothing much, really. A monkey wrench, some screwdrivers. Not a handyman’s treasure trove, but it’s better than nothing! Ha-ha. Now, if you’ll just follow me into the kitchen…”","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Kitchen":["^\"Ah yes, the kitchen. The place where a house becomes a home. You've got all the amenities here that you could need, a fridge, an oven, a sink, some cupboards... Really, what else could you need? ... And if you'll follow me across the hall, we can check out the bathroom.\"","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Bathroom":["^\"Just the usual setup - toilet, sink, bathtub. Nothing too fancy, but then again, when have you ever seen a bathroom be fancy? Ha-ha. Now, I'd offer to take you downstairs, but the only thing that's really down there is the boiler, so there's not really much to see. I'm sure you'll just use the space for storage anyway.

Sheets not included, of course. Sadly, this used to be part of the attic before the latest renovations, and there's no sockets to plug anything in up here, so you'll have to rely on natural light for the most part. But if you need a light during the night, we heard from the last resident that candles light up the space phenomenally.\"","\n","^\"Well, that's just about everything. Now, if you'll follow me back to the kitchen, we can move on to signing some transfer documents, and from there the place is yours.\"","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"Wander":["^This isn’t about you.
